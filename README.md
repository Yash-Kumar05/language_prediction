✨ Language Detection Project 🌍

This project is an AI-powered Language Detection System designed to automatically recognize the language of any input text. It uses Machine Learning and Deep Learning algorithms to understand language patterns and classify them correctly.

🔹 Core Language: Python – used for complete backend development
🔹 Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow & Keras – for building and training neural networks
🔹 Dataset: CSV file containing multilingual text samples for training
🔹 Preprocessing:
    ✔ Text cleaning
    ✔ Tokenization
    ✔ Sequence padding
🔹 Model Architecture:
    ✔ Embedding layer
    ✔ RNN / LSTM layer
    ✔ Dense output layer
🔹 Model Saving: Pickle & .h5 format
🔹 Deployment: Streamlit web application
